**How to Use:**

* **Step 1: Choose a Profile.**
    * The **Epic Recommended** profile is based on research into best practices for asset organization within Unreal Engine.
    * The **Custom Profile** allows you to define your own rules, specifying asset types and their desired destination paths with greater precision.

* **Step 2: Choose an Organization Mode.**
    * **Simple:** This mode moves assets directly to the folders specified in your chosen DataAsset.
    * **By Name (Experimental):** This mode organizes assets based on their type structure combined with a common name (e.g., `BP_Hero`, `N_Hero`, `BT_Hero` â€“ all these assets will be stored in a `Hero` folder). *Due to its experimental nature, please use this mode with caution.*

* **Step 3: Analyze Assets in Your Project.** Before making any changes, the tool allows you to analyze how your assets will be organized.

* **Step 4: Run!** Once you are satisfied with the analysis, execute the organization process.
